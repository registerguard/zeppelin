## Usage

… coming soon …

### Dependencies:

This project depends on [Headroom.js](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js).

Using [Bower](http://bower.io/) is currently the quickest way to install this dependency:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

After cloning locally, `cd` to `source/` and run `bower install`.

Note that `headroom.js` has been symlinked to the `sours/files/scripts/` directory:

```bash
$ ln -s ../plugins/headroom.js/dist/headroom.js ./files/scripts/headroom.js
```
